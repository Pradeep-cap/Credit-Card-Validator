💳 Credit Card Validator (C++)
A simple console-based C++ application to validate credit card numbers using Luhn’s algorithm and identify card types (Visa, MasterCard, American Express, etc.).

🚀 Features
✅ Validates credit card numbers using Luhn's algorithm

✅ Detects card type (Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Discover, etc.)

✅ User-friendly console interface

✅ Strengthens understanding of string manipulation, algorithms, and modular design

🛠️ Requirements
C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang++)
Basic knowledge of running terminal commands

💡 How it works
Luhn’s algorithm checks whether a card number is valid by verifying the checksum.

The program also inspects the card number prefix to identify the card type.

💻 Usage
1️⃣ Compile
bash
g++ main.cpp -o validator

2️⃣ Run
bash
./validator

3️⃣ Input
*******************************
Enter the credit card number without spaces: 4539578803611234
4️⃣ Example Output

4539578803611234 --> This card is VALID ✅
Card Type: Visa
